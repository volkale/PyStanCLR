# PyStanCLR
Stan implementation, with pystan toy example, for fitting linear regression with homoskedastic residuals and optimally compressed data.
The method for optimal data compression for fitting linear models is coming from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11297v3) by J Wong, E Forsell, R Lewis, T Mao, M Wardrop.
Thanks to [Alexander Fischer](https://github.com/s3alfisc) for pointing me to this paper.
